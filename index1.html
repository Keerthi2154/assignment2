           Industrial design is a process of design applied to physical products that are to be manufactured by mass production.[1][2] It is the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features, which takes place in advance of the manufacture or production of the product. It consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication,[3][4] while craft-based design is a process or approach in which the form of the product is determined by the product's creator largely concurrent with the act of its production.[5]
